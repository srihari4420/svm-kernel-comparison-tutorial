# SVM Kernel Comparison

This repository contains the code and tutorial for a small experimental study of
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with different kernel functions. It compares
linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels on several 2D synthetic datasets and
visualises their decision boundaries, support vectors, and performance metrics.

The repository is part of an assignment and is structured so that others can
reproduce the experiments and understand under which conditions they may use
the code and materials.

## Repository Structure

- `notebook/svm_kernel_comparison.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter notebook containing all experiments:
  - dataset generation (moons, circles, blobs)
  - SVM pipelines with feature scaling
  - grid search over hyperparameters (C, gamma, degree, coef0)
  - decision-boundary visualisations and confusion matrices

- `tutorial/svm_kernel_report.pdf`  
  Tutorial-style report explaining:
  - background on SVMs and kernels
  - the experimental setup and datasets
  - interpretation of the plots and results
  - practical guidelines for choosing kernels and tuning hyperparameters

- `artifacts/`  
  (Optional) Directory for saved plots, best models, and CSV summaries
  generated by the notebook. This folder may include:
  - decision boundary figures
  - confusion matrix plots
  - `results_summary.csv`
    

- `requirements.txt`  
  List of Python dependencies needed to run the notebook.

- `LICENSE`  
  The licence that specifies how others are allowed to use this repository.
